      "d": "NORTHWIND is a roleplay survival adventure game centered around the colonization of Quebec. This world bears an expansive, beautiful landscape with magnificent mountains, rivers, caves, and settlements for you to explore. Its resources are at your disposal for however you see fit; discover cooking, hunting, smithing, and take part in many more professions to expand your expertise. Earn pounds by completing vendor quests, hunting criminals for their bounty, trading with others, or by enlisting and rising through the ranks of the redcoat militia. How you take on the frontier is entirely up to you.\n\nThe mobile and console experiences may not be as functional as the PC experience.\n\nThis game is in early access, therefore some features are missing and were specifically replaced by fun, unpredictable bugs. Expect frequent server restarts and some missing content.\n\nhttps://devforum.roblox.com/t/northwind-thanks-contributors/",
